          <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
          <p>
            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
            Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
            River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
            rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and
            deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
            sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
            with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches
            in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
            is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
            free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
            are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
            swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
