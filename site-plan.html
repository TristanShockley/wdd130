        <h2>What to do?</h2>
        <p>Once you decide you need our services, you will feel out a short questionnaire. Doing this will allow workers to see your vision for your Website. After the questionnaire, you will then pay the rate for our services. It will be 25 dollars an hour that we spend working on your Website. We personally make sure we clock in and out, so you are not losing your money on time we spend not on your Website. Once we verify your information, the process will begin to beautify your Website. An associate will reach out to you through a call or text, and this will be the person working on your Website. They will be in constant contact with you throughout the process of them enhancing your site. After they are finished, you will get your final bill, and then you will receive a link where you can review our associate that worked on your site. And that is it! It is a short and easy process, so you can finally have the Website of your dreams!
